#' @title Generate Dendrogram from Molecular Traits or Transformation Data
#' @description This function analyzes molecular traits or transformation data to generate dendrograms that depict the phylogenetic relationships or transformations among different molecular entities based on specified traits or transformation interactions. It supports multiple methods for dendrogram generation, including molecular characterization dendrograms (MCD), transformation dendrograms (TD), and transformed weighted characterization dendrograms (TWCD).
#' @param mol.trait A data frame containing molecular traits which must include a column for molecular formula ('MolForm') and may include other specified traits.
#' @param type A character string specifying the type of dendrogram to generate: 'MCD' for Molecular Characterization Dendrogram, 'TD' for Transformation Dendrogram, and 'TWCD' for Transformed Weighted Characterization Dendrogram.
#' @param peak.2.peak An optional data frame of peak-to-peak relationships, defaulting to `peak.2.peak`. It is used in the TD and TWCD methods to determine the connections based on transformations.
#' @param trait.names A vector of character strings specifying the names of molecular traits to use in the analysis. Default: c("Mass", "C", "kdefect.CH2", "OtoC_ratio", "HtoC_ratio", "NtoC_ratio", "PtoC_ratio", "NtoP_ratio", "StoC_ratio", "AI_Mod", "DBE", "DBE_O", "DBE_AI", "GFE", "NOSC", "Y_met")
#' @return A dendrogram object representing the relationships among molecules.
