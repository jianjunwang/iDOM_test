# iDOM

Ecological networks of dissolved organic matter and microorganisms under
global change.

## About

The package includes functions for analyzing the thermal responses, assembly processes, transformation and microbial associations of DOM.

Package maintainer: Jianjun Wang(<jjwang@niglas.ac.cn>)

Developers: Ang Hu, Fanfan
Meng

## Installation

You can install the development version of **iDOM** from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jianjunwang/iDOM")
```

Installing packages in R from zip source.You may have downloaded
**iDOM** in ***zip*** or ***tar.gz*** format. In order to install the
package from a local zip file you just need to call the install.packages
function with arguments repos = NULL and type = “source”.

``` r
install.packages("file_path/package_file_name.extension",repos = NULL, type = "source")
```

## Key functions in iDOM package

[DOM.H2](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.12.456177): Calculates the
network-level specialization of all interacting trophic levels in
DOM-microbe bipartite networks, including full, negative and positive
networks.

**iCER**: The function of iCTR is relevant to Hu et al. (under review). The manuscript will be available as preprint soon. The code will be updated upon acceptance.
